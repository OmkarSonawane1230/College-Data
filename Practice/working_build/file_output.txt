In C++, file manipulation is very similar to C but often involves the 
use of C++'s fstream library, which provides classes for handling files 
more conveniently. Below is a breakdown of file pointer manipulation 
functions, with examples, using C++'s ifstream, ofstream, and fstream 
classes (which are part of the <fstream> library).


Function    Description	                                    Example Use Case
seekg()	    Move the input file pointer	                    Move to a specific byte for reading
seekp()	    Move the output file pointer	                Move to a specific byte for writing
tellg()	    Get the current position of the input pointer	Retrieve current read position
tellp()	    Get the current position of the output pointer	Retrieve current write position
eof()       Check if the end of the file has been reached	Detect when to stop reading
close()     Close the file	                                Close an open file
